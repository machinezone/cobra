```

## [2.5.5] - 2019-12-05

* (client) add --tidy to the monitor subcommand to only print generic info

## [2.5.4] - 2019-12-04

* (server) rtm/publish handler: ignore empty channels (which gets serialized as "None")

## [2.5.3] - 2019-12-04

* (client) cobra health command parameters consistent with other commands
* (sdk) publish cobras package to npm

## [2.5.2] - 2019-12-02

* (server) improve redis subscription logging

## [2.5.1] - 2019-12-02

* (server + client) subscribe interface changed to receive multiple messages

The --batch_size option can be specified to the `subscribe` sub-command to request messages to be delivered in batch. This is convenient when a subscriber expects lots of messages to be received, as it saves the various overhead of sending smaller individual messages. Notice how all msg count received are a multiple of 50 in the example below, where we request a batch size of 50 messages.

```
~ $ cobra subscribe --endpoint wss://example.com --appkey XXXX --rolename _sub --rolesecret YYYYYYY --channel channel_name \
    --disable_debug_memory \
    --batch_size 50
position None #messages 0 msg/s 0

* add per channel statistics for publish and subscribe

## [2.3.7] - 2019-11-13

* (deps) bump websockets lib dependency to 8.1

## [2.3.6] - 2019-11-12

* (client) async method call needs to be awaited

## [2.3.5] - 2019-11-12

* (client) In connection code, bring back slower code which does not leak and is exception safe

## [2.3.1] - 2019-10-18

* All tasks are given an exception handler to log errors into sentry

## [2.3.0] - 2019-10-18

* Switch to rapidjson from standard json as it is noticeably faster, the only downside is that it takes longer to install / make Docker containers

## [2.2.5] - 2019-10-17

* Bump sentry_sdk dependency

## [2.2.4] - 2019-10-17

* Fix performance problem when saving the last position received when subscribing (--resume_from_last_position)

## [2.2.3] - 2019-10-17

* Docker file second layer still reference an old Python. Default read/write subcommands channel clashes with the default publish/subcribe, so make it unique. Add --repeat option to write subcommand to indefinitely write.

## [2.2.2] - 2019-10-16

* Bump to python 3.8.0 proper. getVersion utility can take a module name.

* bump sentry_sdk to 0.12.3

## [2.1.7] - 2019-10-02

* redis connections from the pipelined publishers are closed when terminating the app (mostly useful to get rid of python 3.8rc1 warnings when running the unittest)

## [2.1.6] - 2019-10-01

* display all http headers when catching zlib decompression error explicitly and logging an error

## [2.1.5] - 2019-10-01

* catch zlib decompression error explicitly and log an error including the connection id

## [2.1.4] - 2019-09-30

* sentry integration / report the user agent properly using the current sentry Hub (see https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/483)

## [2.1.3] - 2019-09-30

* redis subscription: detect max number of clients reached error and fail rtm/subscribe commands

* fix redis connection leak in rtm/delete

## [2.1.0] - 2019-09-25

* bump aio-redis dependency to 1.3.0

## [2.0.0] - 2019-09-19

* cobra works with python3.8 (beta4 at this point)

## [1.9.0] - 2019-09-18

* server / LIKE expression follows more closely the SQL standard, using globbing/fnmatch to evaluate expressions. LIKE can be used to compute startswith and endswith queries for strings. % (match all) and _ (match one) characters are supported, and mapped to * and ? fnmatch globbing special characters.

## [1.8.2] - 2019-09-17

* server / add a channel_max_length apps config parameter that limits how many messages can be retained in a single channel. Still default to a 1000 messages. The parameter is a global, top level yaml config for now. It is likely that we will make it a per appkey settings. In the example below we set it to 100. This parameter is helpful if you are trying to use cobra to transfer large messages.

```
$ head ~/.cobra.yaml
batch_publish_size: 50
channel_max_length: 100
```

## [1.8.1] - 2019-09-17

* server / user-agent recorded as a sentry context info is a python 3.7 Context Variable
* server / log a warning instead of an error when a connection is made with an invalid appkey

## [1.8.0] - 2019-09-17

* server / record user-agent as a sentry context info

## [1.7.9] - 2019-09-17

* server / log an error when a connection is made with an invalid appkey

## [1.7.8] - 2019-09-11

## [1.7.7] - 2019-09-11

* bump sentry_sdk dep to 0.11.2

## [1.7.6] - 2019-09-11

* server / connection state holds a userAgent and has a __repr__ method, this should work with sentry errors to identify bad clients

## [1.7.5] - 2019-09-11

* server / connection id is 12 byte long, instead of 8. This might help with some rare collisions.

## [1.7.4] - 2019-09-10

* server / make disk logging work on Windows by using tempfile.gettempdir() instead of /tmp/

## [1.7.3] - 2019-09-09

* client / when closing a connection, make sure to unsubscribe all subscriptions

## [1.7.1] - 2019-08-29

### Changed

```
(venv) cobra$ cobra publish --url 'ws://jeanserge.com/v2?appkey=_health' --repeat --delay 0.001 --secret A5a3BdEfbc6Df5AAFFcadE7F9Dd7F17E --role health

## [1.5.0] - 2019-08-16
### Changed

- (bavarde cli) fix history

## [1.4.13] - 2019-08-16
### Changed

- (bavarde cli) add --verbose flag which works like the cobra flag.

## [1.4.12] - 2019-08-16
### Changed

- Catch and display readable error when failing to start the server. Classic case is running it twice in two terminals, binding to the same port.

```
2019-08-16 22:34:27 CRITICAL Cannot start cobra server: [Errno 48] error while attempting to bind on address ('127.0.0.1', 8765): address already in use
```

## [1.4.11] - 2019-08-16
### Changed

- --verbose (short -v) can be passed in to all cobra commands, and almost all printing goes through the logging library. Logging format is simplified by removing hostname and username.

```
2019-08-16 21:57:56 INFO < {'action': 'rtm/publish/ok', 'id': 2, 'body': {}}
```

## [1.4.10] - 2019-08-16
### Changed

- (bavarde client) when cancelling with Ctrl-C if a connection was not established yet, do not try to terminate it

## [1.4.6] - 2019-08-16
### Changed

- (server) when running inside docker with a non default port (COBRA_PORT), health check fails as it is trying to use the default port (8765). Modified healt check to look at COBRA_PORT environment variable

## [1.4.5] - 2019-08-16
### Changed

- fix unittest (kv read/write)

## [1.4.4] - 2019-08-16
### Changed

- (server) handle more exception types when failing to connect to redis (such as cannot resolve DNS name)

## [1.4.3] - 2019-08-16
### Changed

- (server) Handle invalid COBRA_APPS_CONFIG_CONTENT values

## [1.4.2] - 2019-08-16
### Changed

- health check return non 0 exit code when a problem happens, instead of retrying to connect and succeed

## [1.4.1] - 2019-08-16
### Changed

- client: fix hang when an exception is thrown (disconnection with the server for example) inside the coroutine waiting for server data

## [1.4.0] - 2019-08-16
### Changed

- Fix very unflexible design in the client code, where the client heavily expected server responses in a specific order. New design is more flexible, and concurrent subscriptions or multiple publish can happens at the same time.
- Server send a response to acknowledge publish messages.

## [1.3.4] - 2019-08-15

### Changed
- cobra can start if redis is down. Not being able to publish statistics is a non fatal error
- COBRA_APPS_CONFIG_CONTENT contains data that is gziped first before being encoded with base64. You can generate that blob with `gzip -c ~/.cobra.yaml | base64` on macOS, or `gzip -c ~/.cobra.yaml | openssl base64` if you have openssl installed ; you'll need to join all the blobs so that they are all on the same line in that case.

## [1.3.3] - 2019-08-15

### Changed
- cobra run can use an environment variable, COBRA_APPS_CONFIG_CONTENT, to specify the content of the configuration file

## [1.3.0] - 2019-08-15

### Changed
- Server has a simple key value store, internally storing data in stream (at the 'tip' of it). A value can be retrieved at a certain position.
- New `cobra read` and `cobra write` commands, to work with the Key Value Store

## [1.2.8] - 2019-08-14

### Changed
- `cobra publish` command broke because of refactoring
- use new exceptions types from websockets 8.0.2 to get better logging about connection termination

## [1.2.7] - 2019-08-13

### Changed
- update to websockets 8.0.2
- unittest does not run with warnings

## [1.2.6] - 2019-08-12

### Changed
- bavarde: colorize output
- client API changed, new connection class (wip)
- client subscriber API changed, takes a parsed json message + position

## [1.2.5] - 2019-08-12

### Changed
- bavarde client: first prompt line is not displayed with a regular prompt

## [1.2.4] - 2019-08-12

### Changed
- bavarde client: exiting with Ctrl-C cancel the subscription. Get rid of the message: `Task was destroyed but it is pending!`
- bavarde client: first prompt line is not displayed with a regular prompt

## [1.2.3] - 2019-08-10

### Changed
- bavarde client displays a time indication

```
[18:43:06] bsergeant> sdc
[18:43:06] bsergeant> adc
[18:45:17] bsergeant> dddddddddddd
```

## [1.2.2] - 2019-08-09

### Changed
- cobra server will reject invalid position when subscribing instead of ignoring it, which seems to trigger a hang when calling XREAD on a stream (needs to investigate)

## [1.2.0] - 2019-08-09

### Changed
- Add example code for a chat command line interactive client named bavarde. The chat connects to a public cobra server. Many features from a decent chat are missing, Most of the interactive chat code was taken from the websockets library.

## [1.1.1] - 2019-08-07

### Changed
- Use a more elegant way to retrieve cobras version number, with pkg_resources module.
- (health-check client) handle publish that triggers a server error (when redis is misconfigured)

## [1.1.0] - 2019-08-03

### Changed
- Implement permissions, to give certain roles publish or subscribe only permission. This can be used to add security and restrict a client in the wild to only publish its own data to a channel, but not to be able to look at traffic from different apps by subscribing on the same channel
- Improve error reporting in the health check command
- Make unsubscribing in the server code more robust, when passing in bogus data
- Add history support. Each published message has an id called a position. That id can be used when subscribing to retrieve messages that a subscriber would have missed if it was down while that message was published.
- Add read command (client + server) to retrieve one element from history. A write and a delete command are comming.
- Add --hide_roles, --hide_nodes and --system options to the monitor command, to deal with displaying info about cobra deployments with lots of nodes or roles. --system info does not display publish/subscribe statistics by nodes but instead system info such as connection count and numbers of asyncio tasks.

## [1.0.0] - 2019-07-31

### Changed
- Redis Streams instead of Redis PubSub are used internally to dispatch messages. History is not used at this point, so the change is really a pure swap without any added features, but we are ready for taking advantage of history.

## [0.0.196] - 2019-07-26
### Changed
- Initial release
